We plant the seed for you to grow, so you can eat and begin to glow,

With health that comes from fresh whole food, and energy that is pursued.

Not only nutritious, you can't beat the taste, more value for money, when you compost the waste.

From garden to table, we offer recipes and tips, in line with our philosophy of biodynamics.

Our planet's important, we know what it's worth, all our operations are friendly to the earth.

Choose what's in season, to give your best shot, of rearing your seedling in your coconut pot.

Hand-raised with love, conversation and care, creating harmony as music wafts through the air.

In your future you must intervene, please support our business, simple, sustainable and green.

Buy from us and we'll donate coins of gold, to benefit the aged and watch their legacies unfold.

Contributing to the Foundation of Walmer House, is as easy as the click of a mouse.

We appreciate life from start to end, that's why we pledge the money you spend.
